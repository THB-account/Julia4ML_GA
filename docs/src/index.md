# Julia4ML_GA

[Julia4ML_GA](https://github.com/THB-account/Julia4ML_GA.jl) is a package for genetic algorithms.

## What is a genetic algorithm

Genetic algorithms solve optimization problems by
- creating a *population* of candidate solutions
- evaluating them with a *fitness function* and iteratively selecting only the best candidates
- maintaining the population size by creating new *populants*
- creating new populants through *crossover* between successful populants
- *mutating* populants in random places of their *genome*
