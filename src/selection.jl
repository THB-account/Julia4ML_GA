    roulette_wheel(rng, fitness, selection_number)

Implements a simple roulette_wheel.
`rng` is an instance of a random number generator to produce reproducible results.
`fitness` is a vector pf fitness values. 
The higher, the more likely the corresponding chromosome is selected.
`selection_number` indicates how many indices are returned.
`result` stores the indices of the chromosomes.
